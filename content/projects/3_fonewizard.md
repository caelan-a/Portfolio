    <h1>Client</h1>

    <h1>Project</h1>

    <p>
    Beginning in 2017, FoneWizard commissioned me to create an app that would allow users to remotely calculate a quote for the value of their phone. It would do this by first reading a plethora of system info such as brand, storage size etc. It would then take the user through a series of tests that would allow them to report on the condition of components including: <br/>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
    <li>
    Camera
    </li>
        <li>
    LCD Screen
    </li>
        <li>
    Audio
    </li>
        <li>
    Bluetooth
    </li>
            <li>
    Wifi
    </li>
    </ul>

It would then allow them to accept this quote, provide contact and payment details before awaiting instructions from FoneWizard on how to send in their device to receive payment. 

    </p>

        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <p>
         This app required custom plugins to be developed that interfaced with both native android and ios platform functions. This was to faciliate the specialised testing required such as:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
    <li>
    Testing variable number of device cameras to determine condition
    </li>
        <li>
     Testing of Bluetooth and Wifi connectivity 
    </li>
        <li>
    Testing of headset and speaker audio
    </li>
        <li>
    Touchscreen
    </li>
            <li>
    LCD
    </li>
    </ul>


Customer input forms for contact, payment and shipping was a great feature of this app. It supported features such as:
     <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
    <li>
    Data validation across every field
    </li>
        <li>
    Autocomplete for UK-centric location fields 
    </li>
        <li>
    Remote validation of bank details via API
    </li>
 
    </ul>
        </p>
